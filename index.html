<u>Week 2</u>
<br> 8/29/22 - 9/2/22 </br>
Today we made a design of Dasani water with tinkercad. It was harder than I expected. I used many different shapes and 
it took a long time to finally get it right but I wasn't able to wrap the "Dasani" text around the water bottle. Overall 
it was a very stressful experience but I still enjoyed it. I thought I did pretty well but I saw other's designs and my 
jaw dropped. :D We also started to work on the Rube Goldberg Machines. I created an incline, pulley, and lever. We created 
3D designs on tinkercad but it was challenging to be so precise with all the measurements. Creating the design was especially 
hard, as I had no idea how to pop a ballon using a baseball. Youtube helped me to create my design and incorporate at least 
three mechanisms in this project. I think I did well regarless. This week was interesting and now I know how hard the designing 
process actually is.

<u>Week 3</u>
<br> 9/5/22 - 9/9/22 <br/>
We started off the week with continuing our Rube Goldberg Machines. We got into groups and chose the best design to put 
to life. We did not end up choosing my design but the design we did choose was simple and effective so it all worked out. 
The design we did choose had all the correct measurements and had an easy to make structure. I am glad we chose that design 
it looked very easy to make. For our challenge, we created an E with another person's measurements. Using paper, we cut out 
the Es. I surprisingly did not make any mistakes. It was pretty easy considering the crafts I've done in the past. This week 
was light and enjoyable.

 <u>Week 4</u>
 <br> 9/12/22 - 9/16/22 <br/>
 This week we finally started building the Rube Goldberg Machine. It was a bumpy start to find out what were should do with 
 the ciruclar parts of the machine but we figured it out but just using square/rectangular parts instead. My group did not
 stick to the original design but we learned that if there ever was an error, the design would be sent back to the offices, 
 they would have to fix their errors, and send it back to redo the machine. We, however got a free pass and didn't have to 
 redo the tinkercad. We finished quickly and had time to spare. On Friday we had another challenge. We made a paper boat 
 and saw how long it would float in water and how much weight it could hold. I was satisfied with my design but again, it 
 wasn't chosen. The deisgn we did pick sunk in under 1 second :/ I think we could've lasted a lot longer with my paper boat 
 because it had a larger surface area and taller sides so water wouldn't leak through. Although I was dissapointed that my 
 design wasn't chosen, it was still fun to see other's boat float and succeed.

 <u>Week 5</u>
  <br>9/19/22 - 9/23/22 <br/>
  This week we finally tested out our Rube Goldberg Machine. We came into class and heard that a group's machine was knocked 
  over and broken so I was praying it wasn't ours, but it was ;/ Fortunately, it wasn't too damaged to the point where we had 
  to reconstruct everything but it still took some time to repair. It was very difficult and there were many fails but we ended 
  up successfully popping the balloon. We had many struggles and debates but I am glad it turned out okay. We spent all of Wednesday 
  doing the MAP testing but couldn't get into the website for an entire period. The strategy to getting in was a complete fail 
  so we tried again after snack and we finally got in. Many people finished but I still had many questions left. On Friday, 
  I caught a cold so I wasn't able to participate in class. This week was fun but also stressful because of our broken machine.

 <u>Week 6</u>
  <br> 9/26/22 - 9/30/22 <br/>
  We started a new type of engineering this week, computer engineering. A guest speaker talked about his job as a computer 
  engineer and basics of a computer. We learned how to disect a computer and we worked on it for the whole week. I thought 
  it was going to be easy because of the provided steps but it was not. It was especially hard to take out the keyboard and
  I think we might have broken a key... The entire process of taking the computer apart was time consuming but I could easily
  find where each step was on the computer. We did have difficulty coloring the worksheet. We didn't know many parts of the 
  computer so it has hard to locate the different parts of the computer but we did it eventually. Putting the computer back 
  together was the hardest part. Although I describes the different screw for each step with great detail, it was still hard 
  to find the correct screw. Overall, this activity was interesting but very stressful.

<u>Week 7</u>
<br>10/3/22 - 10/7/22<br/>
Today we started working on bioengineering. We got to choose our own animals and make a prosthetic limb for them. I chose a 
dolphin and its fin. This prosthetic tail has been made before but I tried making it better than the original. I added 
components of a human flipper for the dolphin tail. I think my tinkercad came our great and it really looks like a dolphin’s 
tail. It is supposed to be made out of On Friday we focused on the steps to making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
It was very hard to write down every single step, opening the bag of bread, taking out a plate, etc. It needed to be very
detailed and I think it helped me realized how specific everything has to be in order to correctly create something. <br>

 <u>Week 8</u>
<br>10/10/22 - 10/14/22<br/>
This week we started on aerospace engineering. It is not the type of engineering I
would want to do just because of all the work that goes into each individual part of the airplane.
We started off this week by creating our own plastic waterbottle rocket designs on tinkercad. I am
very unsure of what it is supposed to look like but I tried my best to make it look good. The materials
needed for my rocket are very minimal which I like. My design is simple and easy to look at.
On Thursday, we designed and created our own paper airplanes. The goal was to hit the orange bucket from
the second floor of the 1000 building but I was unsuccessful. My airplane was called the 
"World Record Paper Airplane" but it did not meet up to my expectations. My airplane did not glide
smoothly because I threw it aggressively and the wind was also messing it up. It was a fun challenge
and it felt nice to go outside and get some air while still doing an assignment.

<u>Week 9</u>
<br>10/17/22 - 10/21/22<br/>
We started actually building our rockets this week. We unfortunately did not choose my idea
but I think my tinkercad was the easiest to make. We used Greg's idea and we started building.
The calculations were off so we had to redo some cardboard parts but it was okay in the end.
We took a really short amount of time to build the rocket because the only parts we needed were
a bottle, cardboard, and paper. I absent on friday because I was at cheer but they told me that
our rocket had a leak when they tested it out. I think my model could have worked a bit better
and made the rocket go further. If I were to redo it I would've added components of my rocket
to Greg's so our ideas would be combined. I learned how to build a mini rocket and it was fun to make.
I wish I could've seen it on Friday but from what I've heard it was not a pretty sight.
Overall I actually enjoyed making the rocket and seeing other's as well.

<u>Week 10</u>
<br>10/24/22 - 10/28/22<br/>
This week we continued on from last week and did water filtering. We used big rocks,
small rocks, tissue/cotton, sand, and a waterbottle to do this. My group wanted to be
"different" and did the opposite order than everybody else did, first big rock, then small,
then the sand, then cotton. Of couse, ours filter the worst out of all the other groups
but it was fun. I learned how to filter dirty, polluted water. I also saw how much of a
difference filitering it multiple times can do for the dirty water. We also did a candycorn
challenge. We had to figure out how many candycorns could fit on one piece of paper
using 10 candycorns. Our group was the closest to the actual amount and I was ver
proud. This week was full of activities and it was very fun to physically see the water
filtering and do hands on projects.

<u>Week 11</u>
<br>10/31/22 - 11/4/22<br/>
We started week 1 of electrical engineering. I have no clue about this but I will try my best. We started by learning
about the OHMs law and completed a worksheet on it. It was pretty easy considering
it was just math and plugging in numbers but I know the actual process is not that easy.
We used tinkercad to create our own breadboards with resistors, cathodes, etc.
It was hard undestanding but I eventually got it. Lighting up the LED cathode was
hard on tinkercad but I finally found out how to do it properly. We learned how to
do parallels and series. I couldn't understand the pictures so I just followed
what was on the board. This week was fun and I tried something I wouldn't ever
try out.

<br>
<u>Week 12</u>
<br>11/7/22 - 11/11/22<br/>
We started week 2 of electrical engineering. We got to do a hands on activity this
week. We got a circuit mulimeter worksheet to guide us. My partner and I were
extremely confused in the beginning but we eventually figured out how to do it.
It was interesting to see the different small parts and seeing the little LED
cathode light up. It was very complicated and stressful. The multimeter was
hard to use but Ms. Petrosian helped us so we finally got it. Making the
tinkercad the week before really made it easier to figure out what to do and where
to connect everything to. We got into many struggles throughout the entire process.
I wouldn't want to be an electrical engineer because of how confusing the circuits
are.

<u>Week 13</u>
<br>11/14/22 - 11/18/22<br/>
This week we learned about Arduino’s.
We set up an Aurduino account and started a hands on activity on Wednesday.
I don’t think I understood this week of engineering because it was so
complicated. I understood how to use the board and wires well but not the coding.
But I  did learn more from last week and I think I have improved.
I do not think I will be an electrical engineer.
It was very difficult to understand.
On Friday, we did a challenge, doors vs wheels.
I was on the wheel side and it is obvious there are more wheels
but my team was bad at defending themselves so we lost.
The other team made a questionable analogy about books being door?
I do not agree with that at all because it is not physically a door that
opens up to a place.
This week was hard but it was still fun.

<u>Week 14</u>
<br>11/21/22 - 11/25/22<br/>
We are starting civil engineering and we are going to stay on this for three
weeks. We learned that this will be our final. We start off with 100 pieces
of spaghetti and we have five tries to make it hold a bucket of water. It
honestly seems impossible… We first created a tinkercad design and we
chose Ashley’s. We soon realized that the design made no sense haha.
We tried to compromise by just making a new design from scratch and
it was very tedious. It took way too long cutting the pieces and gluing it
and it looked like it was going to snap. We are going to start testing next
week so we’ll see if I breaks. I think we need more time to figure out how
real bridges work so we can design the spaghetti bridge off of that.
