 This is my first blog.
 Today I made a design of Dasani water with tinkercad. It was harder than I expected. I used many different shapes and it took a long time to finally get it right but I wasn't able to wrap the "Dasani" text around the water bottle. Overall it was a very stressful experience but I still enjoyed it.
